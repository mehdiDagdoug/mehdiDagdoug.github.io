## Current courses

I am currently the instructor for the following courses at McGill University:

- MATH 533: Regression And Analysis of Variance.
- MATH 525: Sampling Theory and Applications.

The material for these courses can be found on the MyCourses website.

## Older courses taught

During my PhD, I have been a teaching assistant in bachelor's and master's programs, for both mathematical and computer sciences-oriented classes. The courses for which I have been a teaching assistant can be found below, for each academic year. The courses were given for a [master's degree in statistical modeling](https://lmb.univ-fcomte.fr/Master-Mathematiques-Appliquees) as well as a bachelor's degree in science.
