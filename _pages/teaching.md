During my PhD, I have been a teaching assistant in bachelor and master's programs, for both mathematical and computer sciences oriented classes.

The classes for which I have been a teaching assistant can be found below, for each academic year. The classes were given for a [master's degree of statistical modelling](https://lmb.univ-fcomte.fr/Master-Mathematiques-Appliquees) as well as a bachelor's degree in science.

### Courses taught in a Master of Science

- **Research course in statistics: matrix completion and missing data in surveys**: (Master, 2nd year), taught in 2022-2023. 
- **Survey sampling**: (Master, 2nd year), taught in 2021-2022, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023. 
- **Statistical learning**: (Master, 2nd year), taught in 2021-2022.
- **Python**: (Master, 2nd year), taught in 2021-2022 and 2020-2021.

### Science popularization and interactions with secondary school
- Conference for the final of "Rallye de mathématique des collégiens 2022" entitled "What is survey sampling?" (~150 attendees).
- Conference for the final of "Rallye de mathématique des lycéens 2022" entitled "Titanic, between a maritime expedition and a walk in random forests" (~100 attendees).
- Creation of a science popularization workshop for high school students entitled *Titanic, between a maritime expedition and a walk in random forests* (~30 attendees).
