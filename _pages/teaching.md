#### Teaching
During my PhD, I have been a teaching assistant in bachelor and master's programs, for both mathematical and computer sciences oriented classes.

The classes for which I have been a teaching assistant can be found below, for each academic year. The classes were given for a [master's degree of statistical modelling](https://lmb.univ-fcomte.fr/Master-Mathematiques-Appliquees) as well as a bachelor's degree in science.


- **Statistical learning**: (Master, 2nd year), taught in 2021-2022.
- **Survey sampling**: (Master, 2nd year), taught in 2021-2022 and 2020-2021.
- **Python**: (Master, 2nd year), taught in 2021-2022 and 2020-2021.
- **Oriented-object programming with C++**: (Master, 1st year), taught in 2021-2022, 2020-2021 and 2019-2020.
- **Advanced R**: (Master, 1st year), taught in 2021-2022, 2020-2021 and 2019-2020.
- **Calculus**: (Bachelor, 1st year), taught in 2020-2021 and 2019-2020 (two classes).

#### Science popularization and interactions with secondary school
- Creation of a science popularization workshop for high school students entitled *Titanic, between a maritime expedition and a walk in random forests* (~30 attendees).
- Conference for the final of "Rallye de mathématique des collégiens 2022" entitled "What is survey sampling?" (~150 attendees).
- Conference for the final of "Rallye de mathématique des lycéens 2022" entitled "Titanic, between a maritime expedition and a walk in random forests" (~100 attendees).
