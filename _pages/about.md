I am currently a Postdoctoral fellow at the University of Ottawa in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, working under the supervision of David Haziza.

In 2019, I began a PhD in mathematical statistics in the Laboratory of Mathematics of Besançon, at the Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, working under the supervision of the professors [Camelia Goga](http://goga.perso.math.cnrs.fr) from the Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté and [David Haziza](http://www.davidhaziza.com) from the University of Ottawa. 

On July 12, 2022, I defended my PhD thesis entitled [Statistical learning for high-dimensional sampling](http://mehdiDagdoug.github.io/files/these.pdf).

## Research interests

My main research interest lies in the intersection between the <ins>theory of survey sampling</ins> with possible <ins>missing data</ins> and <ins>statistical learning</ins>. 

More precisely, I am working on developping and analyzing the properties of methodologies for solving estimation problems in survey sampling, with possible nonresponse, using tools from the fields of statistical learning and matrix completion. \
I am particularly interested in cases when the number of covariates is especially large (high-dimensional scenarios). 

More recently, I also began working on <ins>resampling methods</ins> (e.g. cross-validation, jacknife) and their applications for <ins>model selection</ins> in survey sampling and <ins>time series</ins>. See the [Publication](https://mehdidagdoug.github.io/publications/) for details about my publications.


## Teaching

During my PhD, I was a teaching assistant at the University of Bourgogne Franche-Comté for classes in Bachelor and Master degrees. \
I have been teaching classes both in mathematics and computer sciences, both in a Master of Science and a Bachelor of Science. At the Master's level, the classes for which I have been a member of the teaching team include a research course in statistics, statistical learning, survey sampling, oriented-object programming with C++, an advanced R course and Python. At the Bachelor's level, I taught a class on elementary statistics and a class of calculus. For some of these courses, I gave lectures, exercises and coding sessions, while for others I gave only some of these. For more details, see the [Teaching](https://mehdidagdoug.github.io/teaching/) page for more details.

## Awards and distinctions 

In 2022, I had the honor of being named Laureate of the first edition of the Jean-Claude Deville Prize of the French Statistical Society. See the prize [webpage](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/fr/enquetes_modeles_et_applications/groupe_enquetes_modeles_et_applications/683-bourses_et_prix/) for details.

## Grants and fundings

During my Ph.D., my research was supported by grants of the region of Franche-Comté and [Médiamétrie](https://www.mediametrie.fr/en), the french audience measurement company for TV, radio and internet.
