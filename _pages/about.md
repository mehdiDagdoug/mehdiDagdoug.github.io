In 2019, I began a PhD in mathematical statistics in the Laboratory of Mathematics of Besançon, at the Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, working under the supervision of the professors [Camelia Goga](http://goga.perso.math.cnrs.fr) from the Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté and [David Haziza](http://www.davidhaziza.com) from the University of Ottawa. \

On September 12, 2022, I defended my PhD thesis entitled [Statistical learning for high-dimensional sampling](http://mehdiDagdoug.github.io/files/these.pdf).

### Research interests

My main research interest lies in the intersection between the **theory of survey sampling** with possible **missing data** and **statistical learning**. \

More precisely, I am working on developping and analyzing the theoretical and empirical properties of current methodologies aiming at solving estimation problems in survey sampling, with possible nonresponse, using tools from the fields of statistical learning and matrix completion. \
I am particularly interested in cases when the number of covariates is especially large (high-dimensional scenarios). 

More recently, I also began working on resampling methods (e.g. cross-validation, jacknife) and their applications for model selection in survey sampling and time series.


### Teaching

During my PhD, I was also a teaching assistant at the University of Bourgogne Franche-Comté for classes in Bachelor and Master degrees. \
I have been teaching classes both in mathematics (statistical learning, survey sampling, calculus) and computer sciences (oriented-object programming with C++, advanced R course, Python).


### Grants and fundings

My research is currently supported by grants of the region of Franche-Comté and [Médiamétrie](https://www.mediametrie.fr/en), the french audience measurement company for TV, radio and internet.
