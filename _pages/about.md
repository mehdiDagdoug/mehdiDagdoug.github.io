# Bio

Since 2019, I am a PhD student in statistics at the Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, working under the supervision of the professors [Camelia Goga](http://goga.perso.math.cnrs.fr) from the Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté and [David Haziza](http://www.davidhaziza.com) from the University of Ottawa. 

My research interests include the theory of survey sampling, missing data, statistical learning and matrix completion. More precisely, I am working on solving estimation problems in survey sampling, with possible nonresponse, using matrix completion algorithms and statistical learning predictive models. 

I am also a teaching assistant at the University of Bourgogne Franche-Comté for classes in Bachelor and Master degrees. I have been teaching classes both in mathematics (calculus, survey sampling) and computer sciences (oriented-object programming with C++, advanced R course, Python).

My research is currently supported by grants of the region of Franche-Comté and [Médiamétrie](https://www.mediametrie.fr/en), the french audience measurement company for TV, radio and internet. Hence, as part of my PhD, I am also doing some consulting work for Médiamétrie.
