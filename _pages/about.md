In 2019, I began a PhD in mathematical statistics in the Laboratory of Mathematics of Besançon, at the Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, working under the supervision of the professors [Camelia Goga](http://goga.perso.math.cnrs.fr) from the Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté and [David Haziza](http://www.davidhaziza.com) from the University of Ottawa. 

On July 12, 2022, I defended my PhD thesis entitled [Statistical learning for high-dimensional sampling](http://mehdiDagdoug.github.io/files/these.pdf).

I am currently a Postdoctoral fellow at the University of Ottawa in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, working under the supervision of David Haziza.

## Research interests

My main research interest lies in the intersection between the <ins>theory of survey sampling</ins> with possible <ins>missing data</ins> and <ins>statistical learning</ins>. 

More precisely, I am working on developping and analyzing the properties of methodologies for solving estimation problems in survey sampling, with possible nonresponse, using tools from the fields of statistical learning and matrix completion. \
I am particularly interested in cases when the number of covariates is especially large (high-dimensional scenarios). 

More recently, I also began working on <ins>resampling methods</ins> (e.g. cross-validation, jacknife) and their applications for <ins>model selection</ins> in survey sampling and <ins>time series</ins>.


## Teaching

During my PhD, I was also a teaching assistant at the University of Bourgogne Franche-Comté for classes in Bachelor and Master degrees. \
I have been teaching classes both in mathematics (statistical learning, survey sampling, calculus) and computer sciences (oriented-object programming with C++, advanced R course, Python).


## Grants and fundings

My research is currently supported by grants of the region of Franche-Comté and [Médiamétrie](https://www.mediametrie.fr/en), the french audience measurement company for TV, radio and internet.
