In 2019 I began a PhD student in statistics at the Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, working under the supervision of the professors [Camelia Goga](http://goga.perso.math.cnrs.fr) from the Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté and [David Haziza](http://www.davidhaziza.com) from the University of Ottawa. I have defended my thesis entitled "Statistical learning for high-dimensional sampling" on September 12, 2022; the manuscript can be found [here](https://github.com/mehdiDagdoug/mehdiDagdoug.github.io/blob/master/files/Thèse_finale.pdf).


My research interests include the theory of survey sampling, missing data, statistical learning and matrix completion. More precisely, I am working on solving estimation problems in survey sampling, with possible nonresponse, using statistical learning predictive models and matrix completion algorithms. I am particularly interested in cases when the number of covariates is particularly large (high-dimensional scenarios). 

During my PhD, I was also a teaching assistant at the University of Bourgogne Franche-Comté for classes in Bachelor and Master degrees. I have been teaching classes both in mathematics (statistical learning, survey sampling, calculus) and computer sciences (oriented-object programming with C++, advanced R course, Python).

My research is currently supported by grants of the region of Franche-Comté and [Médiamétrie](https://www.mediametrie.fr/en), the french audience measurement company for TV, radio and internet.
