I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at McGill University. My office is located in Burnside Hall (805, rue Sherbrooke Ouest), 12th floor, room 1230.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Ottawa, where I worked under the supervision of [David Haziza](http://www.davidhaziza.com).

I completed a Ph.D. in Mathematics at the Laboratory of Mathematics of Besançon at the Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté. My doctoral work was supervised by [Camelia Goga](http://goga.perso.math.cnrs.fr) (Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté) and David Haziza (University of Ottawa). 

On July 12, 2022, I defended my Ph.D. thesis, entitled [Statistical learning for high-dimensional sampling](http://mehdiDagdoug.github.io/files/these.pdf).

## Research Interests

My main research interest lies at the intersection of the theory of <ins>survey sampling</ins>, the treatment of <ins>missing data</ins>, and <ins>statistical learning</ins>.


More precisely, I am working on developing rigorous inference methods for survey sampling, particularly in the presence of nonresponse. To address complex estimation problems, I rely on tools from statistical learning and aim to study the theoretical properties of the resulting procedures. A central focus of this work is on high-dimensional settings, where the number of auxiliary variables is non-negligible relative to the sample size.

## Teaching

I am currently teaching MATH 533 (Linear regression and analysis of variance) and MATH 525 (Sampling Theory and Applications) at McGill University. For course materials and further details, please visit the McGill myCourses website.

For more information about my teaching, including my previous teaching experience, please visit the [Teaching](https://mehdidagdoug.github.io/teaching/) page.
 
## Awards and Distinctions 

In 2022, I had the honor of being named the laureate of the inaugural Jean-Claude Deville Prize awarded by the French Statistical Society. For more information, please visit the prize's [webpage](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/fr/enquetes_modeles_et_applications/groupe_enquetes_modeles_et_applications/683-bourses_et_prix/).

## Grants and Funding
My current research is supported by grants from NSERC (Discovery Grant) and Mitacs (Accelerate Proposal).

During my Ph.D., my work was funded by the Region of Franche-Comté and [Médiamétrie](https://www.mediametrie.fr/en), the French company specializing in audience measurement for television, radio, and the internet.
