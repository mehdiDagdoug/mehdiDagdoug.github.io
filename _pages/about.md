I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at McGill University. My office is in Burnside Hall (805, rue Sherbrooke Ouest) on the 12th floor, room 1230.

Before that, I was a Postdoctoral fellow at the University of Ottawa in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, working under the supervision of [David Haziza](http://www.davidhaziza.com).

I did a Ph.D. in Mathematics in the Laboratory of Mathematics of Besançon at the Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, working under the supervision of [Camelia Goga](http://goga.perso.math.cnrs.fr) from the Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté and David Haziza from the University of Ottawa. 

On July 12, 2022, I defended my PhD thesis entitled [Statistical learning for high-dimensional sampling](http://mehdiDagdoug.github.io/files/these.pdf).

## Research interests

My main research interest lies at the intersection of the theory of <ins>survey sampling<ins> the treatment of <ins>missing data<ins>, and <ins>statistical learning<ins>.   


More precisely, I am working on developing rigorous inference methods for survey sampling, particularly in the presence of nonresponse. To address complex estimation problems, I rely on tools from statistical learning and aim to study the theoretical properties of the resulting procedures. A central focus of this work is on high-dimensional settings, where the number of auxiliary variables is non-negligible relative to the sample size.

See the [Publication](https://mehdidagdoug.github.io/publications/) page for details about my publications.


## Teaching

I am currently teaching MATH 533 (Linear regression and analysis of variance) and MATH 525 (Sampling Theory and Applications) at McGill University. For details, including the course material, please see the McGill myCourses website.

For more details about teaching, including my previous teaching experience, please see the [Teaching](https://mehdidagdoug.github.io/teaching/) page.
 
## Awards and distinctions 

In 2022, I had the honor of being named Laureate of the first edition of the Jean-Claude Deville Prize of the French Statistical Society. See the Jean-Claude Deville prize [webpage](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/fr/enquetes_modeles_et_applications/groupe_enquetes_modeles_et_applications/683-bourses_et_prix/) for details.

## Grants and funding
I am currently supported by grants from NSERC (Discovery Grants) and Mitacs (Accelerate Proposal). 

During my Ph.D., my research was supported by grants from the region of Franche-Comté and [Médiamétrie](https://www.mediametrie.fr/en), the French audience measurement company for TV, radio, and internet.
